## BODY FAT PREDICTION

Body fat generally refers to adipose tissue, a complex connective tissue with specific roles in metabolism and endocrine function.

Background The conventional measurement of obesity utilises the body mass index (BMI) criterion. Although there are benefits to this method, there is concern that not all individuals at risk of obesity-associated medical conditions are being identified. Whole-body fat percentage (%FM), and specifically visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass, are correlated with and potentially implicated in disease trajectories, but are not fully accounted for through BMI evaluation.
•	DENSITY
Body density is essentially your compactness, or how much you weigh for every square inch of space you take up. Knowing your total body density can be helpful if you plan to use it in equations that help you estimate percent body fat.

•	NECK
The neck is the part of the body on many vertebrates that connects the head with the torso and provides the mobility and movements of the head.

•	ABDOMEN
The abdomen (commonly called the belly) is the body space between the thorax (chest) and pelvis.

•	KNEE
The knee is one of the largest and most complex joints in the body. The knee joins the thigh bone (femur) to the shin bone (tibia). The smaller bone that runs alongside the tibia (fibula) and the kneecap (patella) are the other bones that make the knee joint.
